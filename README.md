## Overview

This project utilizes a customer review dataset to build a Streamlit application that offers:
- Text preprocessing (removing special characters, stopwords, and tokenization)
- Visualization of frequently mentioned words in customer reviews
- Sentiment analysis (positive, neutral, and negative sentiments)
- A chatbot for querying customer feedback and generating actionable insights using GPT-4

---

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: OpenAI GPT-4
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas`, `nltk`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `textblob`
  - `faiss` (for similarity search with embeddings)
- **APIs**: OpenAI API for generating insights and embeddings
- **Visualization**: WordCloud, bar charts, pie charts

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. Install Python 3.x.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Get an API key from OpenAI and set it up in your environment.

## Features

### Preprocessing

The dataset is preprocessed by cleaning the text (removing special characters and stopwords), tokenizing it, and generating embeddings for similarity-based queries.

### Word Cloud & Sentiment Analysis

- **Word Cloud**: Displays the most frequently mentioned words in the reviews.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Categorizes reviews as positive, neutral, or negative based on their polarity.

### Chatbot Insights

The chatbot lets users ask questions about the reviews. It retrieves relevant customer feedback based on query embeddings and generates insights using GPT-4.

## Usage

### Running the Application

To run the app, simply use:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will open the Streamlit interface in your browser, where you can navigate between the **Dashboard** and **Chatbot** views.

### Chatbot Interaction

- Ask questions like: 
  - "What are the common complaints from customers?"
  - "How do customers feel about the Redmi 6?"
  - "What improvements do customers suggest?"
- The chatbot will generate insights and actionable recommendations based on the reviews.

# Customer Feedback Assistant

This project aims to build a **RAG-enabled assistant** that processes customer feedback and provides insights using machine learning models.

## Key Features

- Natural Language Processing for analyzing feedback
- Sentiment analysis to identify positive and negative reviews
- Insights extraction to identify top frequent words and patterns

### Top Words Visualization
The following bar chart shows the most frequent words mentioned in customer reviews:
